              "  'In early 2021, millions of ordinary people across the United States began buying shares of the declining video game store GameStop in increments of tens, hundreds or thousands of dollars. Their investments were mocked by financial experts, who cited the store’s poor underlying metrics. But the masses’ collective action proved shockingly powerful: they pushed GameStop’s price from under $3 to as high as $483 in late January 2021, causing the hedge funds that had bet against it to lose billions of dollars.  Nearly three years later, the new movie Dumb Money attempts to dramatize and make sense of the strange episode. Paul Dano stars as Keith Gill, a trader and livestreamer whose full-throated support of the stock on the subreddit community Wall Street Bets catalyzed a movement around “meme stocks”: assets that surged in price fueled by social media enthusiasm. Seth Rogen, Pete Davidson and America Ferrera all play various characters swept up in the mania that captivated market watchers old and new in the throes of the pandemic.\\xa0 Dumb Money portrays the GameStop craze as a sea change moment in American finance, in which everyday people, known as retail investors, successfully grabbed back power from Wall Street and claimed agency in American financial systems. \"We were drawn to the story of Keith Gill and some of the people who followed him precisely because it’s such an outlier,\" writers Lauren Schucker Blum and Rebecca Angelo told TIME in a statement. \"Retail traders usually underperform the market and the big hedge funds. By focusing on this exceptional moment, we saw a chance to show how the system normally works and why that system needs to be examined.\" The craze altered many important dynamics of investing and financial literacy, and its legacy is still being determined, experts tell TIME. “The whole GameStop thing: they lost,” says Kyla Scanlon, an economics analyst and content creator of the retail investors. “It’s very hard to beat the stock market.”  In conjunction with the release of the movie, TIME explored the impact of the GameStop and meme stock hype on various aspects of the',\n",
              "  'The 2021 Reddit vs Wall Street saga gets a fast and fizzy big screen adaptation with an ensemble cast including Paul Dano and Seth Rogen For those with one eye trained on a news chyron for at least part of the day, it might seem a little too soon to be sitting down to watch Hollywood’s definitive retelling of 2021’s GameStop saga, an all-consuming financial soap opera that forced many of us to suddenly feign expertise in what a short squeeze is. But it’s perhaps fitting that the story, which trickled up from Reddit to Wall Street within weeks and was turned from a CNN ratings-winner to an Amazon bestseller within months, would become a film in just over two years. It was an inevitable race to production with other projects announced around the same time but it was an adaptation of Ben Mezrich’s speedily written The Antisocial Network that won out, now known as Dumb Money, a slick crowd-pleaser that makes light work of a difficult story. For as juicy as the twists and turns may be they were mostly juicy to those who were educated on the specifics of not just the story but the world within which it was playing out. Hollywood’s ongoing obsession with framing tech tales as Shakespearean dramas, with recent films and shows based around the highs and lows of Uber, WeWork and Blackberry, has mostly required very little expertise from viewers going in. They’re familiar industry narratives, old stories with a new setting. Dumb Money requires something a little extra, something that would usually require a no-distractions Wikipedia read, but wrapped up in an appealingly commercial package (Adam McKay’s The Big Short famously used Margot Robbie in a bath to detail the most convoluted financial terminology). In telling the story as an ensemble piece, not just inhabited by characters who are already well-versed on the ins and outs of the market, the screenwriters Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo find ways to translate it for the layman. There’s the man who started it all, Keith Gill (Paul Dano), who used Reddit and YouTube',\n",

This is the type of simple story I’d love to be able to tell about GameStop: In early 2021, a ragtag group of everyday traders, led by a Massachusetts dad going by — depending on your social media platform — Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, took on Wall Street titans and won. The underdogs came out on top, the big bad rich guys wound up on the bottom, and in the process our heroes exposed many of the ways the financial system is rigged. Congress held a high-profile hearing about the incident in which the major players in the saga were involved, and something was likely to come of it. As for GameStop, well, there was still a lot to like about the stock. The whole thing was a virtuous endeavor. It’s the kind of story I could have maybe told pretty soon after the phenomenon began, though it was never that clear-cut — plenty of normie retail investors were just out to make money, just like the people betting on sports and crypto. The sticking-it-to-the-man narrative has never been a clean one. And two and a half years later, the overall GameStop story has become a whole lot messier. GameStop is still struggling. Wall Street is still winning. Nobody really knows what happened to Roaring Kitty. This is all probably good to keep in mind when watching the movie Dumb Money, out in theaters nationwide on September 29. Emily Stewart’s column exposes the ways we’re all being squeezed under capitalism.\\xa0Sign up here.  The movie is well executed, exhilarating, and captures the tenor of the times. It was a true “holy fucking shit” moment, to quote the film. It is also a Hollywood dramatization of something quite complicated — not just because markets are complicated, but because reality is. Wall Street types are pretty meh on the whole episode — one hedge funder I recently talked to told me the idea that',\n",

Yet, this meteoric rise was a double-edged sword, spotlighting potential meme stocks to sell. The sizzle of GameStop’s success lured numerous speculators, with various meme stocks rising by double or even triple-digit margins. Most savvy participants recognized the fragile foundations of these stocks, but the allure of these trajectories proved too tempting to resist. Sadly, gravity took hold, pulling GameStop and others back down, erasing their dazzling gains. Hence, holding onto certain meme stocks now might be playing with fire. Peloton\\xa0(NASDAQ:PTON) is among these meme stocks to sell due to its horizon appearing rather clouded in the aftermath of product recalls and a noteworthy surge in insider stock sales. Its most recently released quarterly report showed per-share losses nearly doubling compared to market expectations with lackluster forward guidance, which led to multiple analyst downgrades. Coupled with a rising churn rate and dreary new subscriber additions, one might ponder if the luxury exercise brand is at its saturation point amongst its target demographic. While its management points to seasonality as a culprit, the undeniable reality is that the company will continue to falter in the post-pandemic world, with inflationary pressures damaging future growth prospects. Amid this turbulence, whispers of a potential acquisition have become louder. A buyout might be the silver lining they’re hoping for — for the company’s sake and its investors. Mullen Automotive\\xa0(NASDAQ:MULN)\\xa0is attempting to rise from its ashes, rallying significantly after a series of market updates, including a $25 million share buyback initiative. A bold maneuver, considering its share price has dropped 90% since February, compounded by a trio of reverse stock splits this year alone. Moreover, despite landing a $63 million purchase order recently, its balance sheets tell a story of a company in duress, grappling with massive operational outflows and a rising cash burn rate, which saw them expending roughly $70 million in the first half',\n",

              "  'Meme stock king Ryan Cohen is taking control of GameStop. The Chewy founder, who already serves as chairman of the board and owns roughly 12% of the company’s stock, has been named president and CEO of the video game retailer. The company has been without a chief executive since June when it terminated former Amazon executive Matt Furlong. Cohen will not draw a salary for the role. Cohen has been looking to revive the once dominant brand since 2021, when he forced out the executive team at GameStop and assumed the chairman’s role. He has pushed the company to embrace e-commerce and launched a marketplace for NFTs, though neither effort has met with much success. He has come under fire from some investors (and analysts) for not announcing a substantial turnaround plan almost two years after taking control of the company His efforts haven’t been a complete failure. GameStop reported a quarterly increase in sales earlier this month as well as a smaller loss. And investors initially welcomed the news Cohen would be solely in charge of the company. Shares spiked 9% when the announcement was made, though they surrendered most of those gains in early trading Thursday. Analysts weren’t impressed by the news.  “Mr. Cohen’s Board is hand picked (mostly colleagues from Chewy), suggesting that his appointment was more of a coronation by his believers,” wrote Wedbush’s Michael Pachter in a note to investors. “We remain convinced that GameStop is doomed, as declining physical software sales and a shift of sales to subscriptions and digital downloads seal its fate.” GameStop, of course, was the original meme stock and remains popular with members of Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets community. Shares at the start of 2021 traded for less than $20, eventually spiking as high as $344. (Since the beginning of the rally, share prices have increased over 500% and returned the company to the Fortune 500 in 2021.) Cohen was also an investor in Bed Bath & Beyond, making that retailer a meme stock, but angered investors last year after completely withdrawing his position days after having indicated in a regulatory',\n",

              " 'TSLA': ['Thursday October 12, 2023 Electric vehicle (EV) sales volumes set another record in Q3, as total sales of battery-powered vehicles jumped past 300,000 for the first time in the U.S. market. Year-to-date EV sales through September reached just over 873,000, putting the market firmly on track to surpass 1\\xa0million for the first time ever. The milestone will likely be achieved in November. Total EV sales in Q3, according to an estimate from Kelley Blue Book, hit 313,086, a 49.8% increase from the same period one year ago and an increase from the 298,039 sold in Q2. Most automakers posted sizeable gains over 2022, with Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes and Hyundai delivering increases above 200%, thanks mostly to new products entering the market. In Q3, 14 new EV models that did not exist one year ago were in the mix, including Chevrolet Blazer and Silverado EVs. (The new Chevy EVs had very low sales – just an initial few to mark a Q3 launch). The EV market is transforming, to be sure. Electric vehicle sales accounted for 7.9% of total industry sales in Q3, a record and up from 6.1% a year ago and 7.2% in Q2. As Cox Automotive has been reporting, higher inventory levels, more product availability, and downward pricing pressure have helped spur continued linear growth of EV sales in the U.S. market. EV sales have now increased for 13 straight quarters. EV transaction prices in Q3 were down significantly from 2022. In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped, as Tesla’s Q3 sales grew by 19.5% year over year, surpassing the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%. However, Tesla’s share of the EV segment continues to plunge, hitting 50% in Q3, the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1. The long-promised Cybertruck may reverse the downward trend, although competition from Ford, Rivian and Chevrolet will likely impact Tesla’s electric pickup volume potential.\\xa0 \\xa0 The German luxury makes – Audi, BMW, and Mercedes – continue to rapidly increase sales of',\n",

While the button can be used to do things like open the camera app, start a voice memo, or turn your flashlight on or off, Tesla owners are using it as a key fob. With just a press of the one button, you can unlock your Tesla, open the trunk, crack the windows, or even get the AC going without turning on your phone\\'s display or even taking it out of your pocket. Teslas don\\'t come with a physical key fob and are instead typically controlled through an app or unlocked with a key card (though one Tesla owner had a chip implanted in the back of his hand to unlock his car). Apple users already had the option of creating specific shortcuts for a variety of actions to control their car in their iPhones, available as virtual shortcuts through a widget or homescreen icon, but the new action button on the iPhone 15 Pro allows owners to trigger one of these shortcuts more conveniently and in a more tactile way, without even having to worry about waking up their iPhone or navigating the homescreen.

Sentiment toward Tesla \\n        TSLA,\\n        -2.99%\\n       earnings for the remainder of the year “skews cautious,” and there’s risk earnings could be revised lower, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note Thursday.  Moreover, many investors “are wondering if Tesla can grow earnings at all” in the next year, with the year ahead seen as “volatile,” said Jonas, who added he recently hosted a group of Tesla investors to discuss their expectations for the company.  There was also “very little enthusiasm” about Tesla’s next model, the Cybertruck, among the investors, Jonas said.  “Teething issues” with the unconventionally styled electric pickup truck are “seen as perpetuating Tesla’s relatively stale model lineup,” with its only recourse being price cuts.  Analysts polled by FactSet expect Tesla to report adjusted earnings of 73 cents a share on sales of $24.3 billion. That would compare with adjusted earnings of $1.05 a share on sales of $21.5 billion, which Tesla reported in the third quarter of 2022. The price cuts, the latest of which were announced last week, rehashed investors’ worry about the company’s margins.   Tesla’s third-quarter earnings report is “all about margins,” Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management said in a recent note.  See also: Rivian’s stock is a buy for UBS as ‘road ahead looks brighter’ for EV maker Operational margins are at the heart of a key investment debate surrounding Tesla,  and whether it is a car company or a tech company, Munster said.  Even more importantly, however, Tesla’s gross margins on vehicles have been falling for the past three quarters, to 18.1% in the June quarter from 24.3% in the December quarter, which is tied to the price cuts.

Elon Musk photographed attending the 2022 Met Gala Celebrating \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" ... [+] at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue) Tesla’s 5.9% increase brought the share price to about $261 for the stock when markets closed Wednesday afternoon. This comes despite a report released Monday that showed a 7% decline in vehicle deliveries during the third quarter, something the company blamed on factories being temporarily shut down for upgrades. Still, investors bet on a fourth-quarter rebound with the launch of a revamped Model 3 car in China and the expected launch of the Cybertruck, according to Investor’s Business Daily. Musk first jumped into the top spot on Forbes’ Billionaires List in September 2021. “I’m sending a giant statue of the digit ‘2’ to Jeffrey B., along with a silver medal,” he told Forbes after overtaking Amazon’s Jeff Bezos—who, with a $149.8 billion estimated net worth, is now No. 3—for the spot. Recently, he and French fashion mogul Bernard Arnault have been flipping back and forth between the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, though Musk has maintained his spot as No. 1 in recent weeks. Around $170.6 billion of his $260.4 billion net worth comes in the form of Tesla stock. Other significant assets include his 42% stake in SpaceX, which amounts to $60.2 billion, and his acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, which is now worth $8.9 billion (he purchased the social media platform for $44 billion). Forbes estimates he has $5.2 billion in cash and other liquid assets. Musk has given away a meager fraction of his wealth to charitable causes, Forbes has found.

However, the electric vehicle sector is likely to create more millionaires in the coming years. Given the fact that EVs are still at an early stage of adoption globally, headroom for growth is immense for some of the best EV companies. It’s time to focus on EV stocks that are worth holding until 2030 that can deliver multibagger returns. To put things into perspective, it’s expected that EV sales will be 14 million cars in 2023. This would imply 18% of total car sales. However, by 2030, EVs are likely to represent more than 60% of total car sales. That multi-fold growth in EV sales would translate into healthy profits for the best EV car makers. This holds true even with intensifying competition. The industry may witness consolidation in the coming years. Let’s explore the reasons to be bullish in the quest to become a millionaire from EV stocks.\\n China-based Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has emerged as an attractive EV player in perspective of growth and value creation. Backed by positive news flow, LI stock has surged by 66% for year to date (YTD). In fact, this could be the beginning of the long-term uptrend.

The company said it is planning to open several showrooms in mainland China that will all be located in popular retail locations where consumers can experience the Fisker brand and get a closer look at its vehicles. 02:18 Electric car designed by Swiss students sets new world record for acceleration  The carmaker is already selling the Ocean SUV in the US and Europe. Last month, the 5,000th Ocean rolled off the production line at contract manufacturer Magna Steyr’s plant in Graz, Austria. In June, Fisker’s top managers visited China to meet government officials and business leaders in Shanghai to discuss collaboration and opportunities, the company said in a statement in June. “I believe we can get production up and running in China as early as next year, potentially adding capacity of 75,000 Fisker Oceans annually,” the CEO said at that time. The Ocean SUV starts at US$37,499 in the US, and competes with the entry-level version of Tesla’s Shanghai-made Model Y, which is priced at 263,900 yuan (US$36,114).

              "  'With likely lower profit margins and commentary on self-driving software, here’s what we’ll be looking for in Tesla’s earnings. Tesla TSLA is set to release its third-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Oct. 18, after the close of trading. Here’s Morningstar’s take on what to look for in Tesla’s earnings and stock. We’ll be looking at three main areas: Automotive profit margins: These are an important gauge of how Tesla’s strategy to cut prices to spur demand is affecting profits. Our base case is that the firm will likely see lower margins in the second half of the year versus the first. Seeing the impact of the price cuts will help us determine the extent to which we would need to modify our profit forecast for the automotive segment. Energy generation and storage profits: Tesla’s automotive segment is still its largest source of revenue and profits, but this segment is growing. EG&S turned profitable last year, and it has generated strong growth in 2023 thanks to a massive spike in energy storage (large batteries) sales. We forecast that this segment will become an important secondary profit source as the market for stationary energy storage continues to grow. New products and services: We will be looking for management commentary on new products and services, namely Cybertruck and full self-driving software. The Cybertruck has been long awaited and would mark the fifth vehicle Tesla could sell to the auto market, giving the company a new vehicle with which to grow volumes. The full self-driving software is one of the largest ancillary profit sources for Tesla, adding a potential new revenue and profit source from every vehicle sold once the full version of the software can be rolled out. We will look for updates from management to see if our outlook for progress is on track. With its 3-star rating, we believe Tesla’s stock is slightly overvalued compared with our long-term fair value estimate. Our fair value estimate is $215 per share. We use a weighted average cost of capital of just under 9%. Our equity valuation adds back nonrecourse and non-dilutive convertible debt.',\n",

              "  'As sales of electric vehicles continue to surge, many new and prospective customers have questions about qualifying for federal tax credit on electric vehicles, especially now that a slew of new credits have been reinstated to US consumers (alongside their fair share of confusing and ever-evolving conditions) Whether you qualify is not a simple yes or no question… well, actually it sort of is, but the amount you may qualify for varies by household due to a number of different factors. Furthermore, new terms implemented January 1, 2023 limit the number of EVs that currently qualify based on a number of factors pertaining to local US manufacturing. Lastly, there are other potential savings available to you that you might not even know about yet. Luckily, we have compiled everything you need to know about tax credits for your new or current electric vehicle into one place. The goal is to help ensure you are receiving the maximum value on your carbon-conscious investment because, let’s face it, you’ve gone green and you deserve it. The idea in theory is quite simple, per the IRS – “You may qualify for a credit up to $7,500 under Internal Revenue Code Section 30D if you buy a new, qualified plug-in EV or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCV). The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 changed the rules for this credit for vehicles purchased from 2023 to 2032. With that said, you cannot simply go out and buy an electric vehicle and expect Uncle Sam to cut $7,500 off your taxes in April. In reality, the amount you qualify for is based on both your income tax as well as several specifications of the electric vehicle you purchase, including where it’s built. More on that below. First, let’s take a second to truly understand how the Federal EV tax credit currently works. First and foremost, it’s important to understand three little words the government slips in front of the $7,500 credit – “may” and “up to.” As in, you may qualify for up to $7,500 in federal tax credit for your electric vehicle.

This as Tesla’s lead at the top is narrowing. According to automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book (KBB), US EV sales in the third quarter crossed 313,000, nearly a 50% increase from a year ago, and around 15,000 more than the 298,000 sold in Q2. Cox Automotive (KBB\\'s parent company) said EV market share hit 7.9%, its highest ever level and up from the 6.1% recorded a year ago. \"Higher inventory levels, more product availability, and downward pricing pressure have helped spur continued linear growth of EV sales in the US market,\" said Jonathan Smoke, Cox Automotive\\'s chief economist. Three years ago, total EV sales for the year passed 250,000, and KBB says this year EV sales are on pace to top 1 million. KBB also noted 14 new EV models were now in the mix, and automakers like Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes, and Hyundai saw EV sales gains of over 200%, though at limited quantities. Of course the 800-pound gorilla in the room is Tesla, which sold over 150,000 EVs in the US, exactly half (50%) of the total amount sold. While a huge amount, Tesla’s share of the pie has been shrinking lately, with 50% its lowest level on record, and down from 62% a year ago. Though Tesla’s market share is slipping, its overall sales volume is increasing — up 19.5% year over year and beating the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%, KBB said. Coinciding with Tesla’s jump in overall sales have been its price cuts, which the company has been implementing aggressively over the past year or so. “In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped,” KBB noted in its report. Ford has also cut prices on its Mustang Mach-E SUV, and Ford Lightning EV pickup; however, big picture in the US at least, EVs are still relatively expensive, and that’s a major concern for consumers.

Despite some recent improvement, TSLA stock is facing challenges today, likely due to the Q3 deliveries report. Currently, it’s down nearly 2% at the time of writing on a volatile day of trading, indicating investors remain cautious on this name heading into its earnings print. Given recent disappointing deliveries numbers, a negative earnings report appears to be widely expected. The following expectations for October 18, as well as other updates, will give you needed insight about Tesla. TSLA stock is dropping, and Wall Street analysts are growing more pessimistic. JPMorgan’s Ryan Brickman maintains a “sell” rating with a $135 target, implying a 45% downside. Goldman Sachs’ Mark Delaney lowered the target to $252, rating it a “hold”. William Stein of Truist Financial suggests a “hold” with a $243 target.  Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein remains bearish with a “sell” rating and a $150 target. Specifically, he cited concerns about Tesla’s auto gross margins, lower volumes, discounts, weak demand, and a lack of new offerings. These combined reasons could potentially require price cuts next year. Moreover, Sacconaghi suggests Tesla must excel in Q4 and possibly lower prices to meet 2023 delivery targets, impacting 2024. Despite adjusted forecasts, recent delivery shortfalls raise concerns. Lowered price targets before earnings indicate skepticism. On October 2, Tesla reported Q3 deliveries of just over 435,000 vehicles, missing Wall Street estimates by over 20,000 and down about 6% from Q2. TSLA attributed this drop to “planned factory upgrades,” maintaining its full-year delivery estimate. Despite an initial dip in share price and increased short interest, the stock remained relatively stable after the report, likely due to two factors. Rivian, Tesla’s competitor, saw a significant surge in its stock today due to better-than-expected Q3 production figures. J.D. Power reported that Q3 U.S. auto sales were up 17% year over year (YOY).

The latest quarterly estimate shows a record 313,086 electric cars sold from July to September, breaching the 300,000 mark for the first time in the third quarter. EVs now account for 7.9% of total auto sales in the United States, up from 6.1% a year ago and 7.2% from the second quarter. One of the biggest drivers of this growth in sales and rise in market share has been the slashing in prices led by Tesla. EV prices are down 22% from a year ago, and the average price paid in September was $50,683. Tesla models have been ahead of the market in cutting prices, with its current starting price at $38,880. High levels of inventory have also helped drive sales. Even as Tesla’s market share comes down from its first-quarter peak, it is nonetheless expected that with the launch of its much-awaited electric pickup vehicle Cybertruck, the Elon Musk-led automobile giant can reverse the downward trend. Tesla currently carries a Zacks #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Ford Motor Company F, General Motors Company GM and Mercedes-Benz Group AG MBGAF are three other automobile majors that have emerged as the leading lights in the American EV segment. While Ford and General Motors have sold more electric cars in the quarter — 20,962 and 20,092 vehicles, respectively — the Germany-based Mercedes group has led the automakers in the U.S. market with 15%. GM, Ford and Mercedes currently carry a Zacks #4 (Sell), #3 and #2 (Buy), respectively. There are many'],\n",

              "  'Former hedge fund manager and host of CNBC’s Mad Money, Jim Cramer Tuesday evening continued with his recent bearish stance on crypto, a stark contrast to what another hedge funder said earlier that day on CNBC. “I can’t go out with gold because gold is not good; I can’t go out with bitcoin [BTC] because I can’t be in something where Mr. Bitcoin is about to go down big,” said Cramer. It’s unclear if “Mr. Bitcoin” was in reference to the ongoing trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, or to bitcoin in general, but Cramer’s bearishness was evident. Although bitcoin is far off its all-time high of $68,000 reached in 2021’s bull market, the cryptocurrency is still trading up 68% since the start of the year. Cramer had previously stated in June 2021 that he had sold most of his bitcoin holdings following China’s crackdown on crypto miners. He also said during the same time period that bitcoin had structural issues and its price would likely fall further. Appearing on CNBC earlier on Tuesday, billionaire hedge fund giant Paul Tudor Jones said he’s a fan of both bitcoin and gold due to the combination of extensive geopolitical risk and rising U.S. government debt levels.',\n",
              "  \"Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) remained little changed over the past 24 hours amid tepid price catalysts and fading volumes in both spot and futures markets. The price of bitcoin appeared set to retake the $27,000 level early Wednesday, but the rally was turned back alongside a renewed slide in the U.S. stock market. FxPro markets analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in a daily note that while cryptocurrencies saw increased buying equity markets were under the most pressure as the dollar was gaining momentum. However, this momentum didn't last long, which dampened bullish outlooks. “These growth impulses promise to remain a bull trap, offering the best opportunity to sell on the upside,” Kuptsikevich said. The trader added that the crypto sector could need banking problems or uncertainty about the solvency of governments to generate sustainable growth momentum. “Recent moves in bond markets show that something like this is brewing,” Kuptsikevich explained, stating that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “need financial chaos for growth.” Meanwhile, alternative tokens were some of the only volatile assets in the crypto market as bitcoin cash (BCH) jumped 8% and DeFi protocol Maker’s MKR tokens rose 7%. Growth in MKR could be tied to an increase in wallet balances holding the token on exchanges, indicating demand. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based index of hundreds of tokens, rose 0.95% in the past 24 hours. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent comments suggested that interest rates may remain high for some time to come, jolting broader markets in the U.S. as traders priced in inflation fears.

              "  'Bitcoin [BTC] Wednesday tumbled below $27,000 for the first time since the start of the month as what’s now a four-day rally in stocks and three consecutive days of falling bond yields failed to ignite any buying interest in the crypto. Bitcoin late in the afternoon on Wednesday was down 2.5% over the past 24 hours, underperforming the CoinDesk Market Index’s (CMI) 1.75% decline. Among large-cap cryptos, the Ripple Labs-related [XRP], litecoin [LTC] and Polkadot’s native token [DOT] fell 2%-3%. Ether [ETH] outperformed BTC and the CMI, declining 0.7% to near $1,550. Crypto derivatives traders who bet on higher prices with long positions suffered $50 million in liquidations during the day, CoinGlass data shows. BTC constituted $22.5 million of the liquidations, marking the second-highest reading this month. The weak price action of crypto occurred as traditional markets continued to post gains, with the Nasdaq advancing 0.7% and the S&P 500 adding 0.4% – both indexes now on a four-day winning streak. Bonds are having a winning streak of their own, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield lower by 10 basis points to 4.56%. It closed last Friday at 4.80%. In economic news, the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) for September came in a bit stronger than expectations. The minutes from the most recent meeting of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) showed most expect one more rate hike before the monetary tightening cycle is complete. Some analysts noted BTC’s remarkable steadiness over past weeks amid falling U.S. stocks and bond market rout. However, that trend appeared to fizzle out after the crypto failed to break above a heavy resistance at around $28,000, a confluence of the 200-day and 200-week moving averages. Popular trader XO said in an X post that “narratives will shift bearish” for bitcoin as “spot holders will start unwinding in fear or lower prices,” hinting at a potential fall below $25,000. Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, noted in an X post that bitcoin broke down from its upward trend starting at its rally from $25,000, and could retest lower levels. #Bitcoin is falling below the',\n",

              "  \"Bitcoin (BTC) has held firmly above the $26,000 level this week despite sharp sell-offs in equity markets and the surging U.S. dollar – a victory of sorts given the bearish signals those other moves could’ve portended. The largest crypto asset by market capitalization changed hands Friday afternoon at around $26,500, slightly up 0.3% since the start of the week. Meanwhile, the benchmark for U.S. stocks, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 2.7% and 3.2%, respectively. IntoTheBlock said in a report that the steady price action was “remarkable” in light of the stock market taking a hit. The analytics firm noted among the potential reasons behind the stability that BTC’s correlation with the Dollar Index (DXY) hit zero, meaning there’s no relationship at all between them. The number of long-term holders – HODLers in crypto slang – are near an all-time high, IntoTheBlock said, which could be a sign that they are refusing to sell before a potential approval of a spot BTC exchange-traded fund in the U.S. “Historically, these long-term investors have helped sustain price during bear markets and take profits as new all-time highs are set in bull markets,” the report said. “This trend appears to signal a bullish cycle for bitcoin may be approaching,” it added. “Though it's unclear how long bitcoin's outperformance will last in a worsening macro environment, on-chain data shows that its long-term investors continue to accumulate regardless.” BTC climbed to as high as $27,400 ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, but turned lower “witnessing strong selling pressure,” Rachel Lin, CEO of derivatives decentralized exchange SynFutures, noted in an email. “Both the 200-weekly moving average and the 200-daily moving average are in the 27,800 level, likely acting as strong resistance in the coming week,” she said, adding that the range between $26,000 and $26,500 acts as a support for prices. In the options market, $24,000 puts and $35,000 call options have the largest open interest, according to Lin. “This suggests the market still believes BTC will stay in that range for the foreseeable future,” she said.

              "  'Bitcoin [BTC] is a monetary good and an attractive store of value in a progressively digital world, Fidelity Digital Assets, a unit of financial services giant Fidelity investments, said last week. Traditional investors tend to use a technology investing framework when analyzing bitcoin, which leads them to the wrong conclusion that the cryptocurrency “as a first-mover technology, will easily be supplanted by a superior one or have lower returns,” analysts Chris Kuiper and Jack Neureuter wrote. However, “bitcoin’s first technological breakthrough was not as a superior payment technology, but as a superior form of money,” the authors wrote. “Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital asset,” the report said, and other cryptocurrencies are unlikely to improve on BTC as a monetary good because it is the most “secure, decentralized, sound digital money.” The success of the Bitcoin network is not mutually exclusive with the success of other networks, the report argued, as the rest of the digital asset ecosystem can service different needs or solve other problems that bitcoin can’t. According to the report, the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s return profile is driven by two powerful tailwinds: “global growth of the broader digital asset ecosystem and the potential instability of traditional macroeconomic conditions.” “Bitcoin should be considered first and separate from all other digital assets that have followed it,” and it should be viewed as an entry point for traditional allocators looking to gain exposure to the sector, the report added.

              "  \"NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ — If you had bought $100 of Bitcoin in 2011, it would have been worth $3m when BTC was trading at $30,000 earlier this year – could Bitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC – bitcoinbsc.io) repeat that feat? Crypto investors certainly think so, which explains why the 'Bitcoin on BNB Smart Chain' staking crypto asset has raised more than $2 million in less than two weeks as its presale races toward the finish line of $3.96 million. Currently priced at just $0.99 in presale – roughly the price Bitcoin was at in 2011 – Bitcoin BSC has a much better risk-reward profile for potential investors than Bitcoin, not to mention the staking yield that generates an income stream to buttress capital returns. To be sure not to miss out on the presale alpha opportunities and the listing, which could be next week, follow the project's X (formerly Twitter) account and join the Telegram group. Bitcoin is in good shape – and Bitcoin BSC will be a top beneficiary Behind the headlines about 'crypto winter' which followed failing crypto banks and exchanges, Bitcoin is actually looking in pretty good shape, and so are the Bitcoin derivative and clone coins that seek to provide a value differential over the original offering. Bitcoin BSC, like Bitcoin, has a total supply of 21 million tokens. However, unlike Bitcoin, it runs on a proof-of-stake network, the BNB Smart Chain, which is a cheaper and more efficient blockchain. The latest Bitcoin alternative coin has something else going for it that Bitcoin doesn't – staking built in by design. If you buy Bitcoin BSC today with BNB, you can start staking and earning yield. Token buyers have jumped at the chance to start locking in passive income. So over 1,000,000 $BTCBSC has been staked and is currently earning an annual percentage yield (APY) of 268%. The current staked tokens amounts to almost half of the total number of sold $BTCBSC to date.

              "  \"The bitcoin (BTC) mining industry is at a crucible moment, as the approval of a spot BTC exchange-traded-fund (ETF) could catalyze a rally against a backdrop of record hashrates and the impending block reward halving that threaten the industry's revenues and profitability, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. The bank favors mining operators that offer the best relative value in light of their “existing hashrate, operational efficiency, power contracts, funded growth plans and liquidity,” analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is Coming and Only the Most Efficient Miners Will Survive JPMorgan initiates coverage of CleanSpark (CLSK) with an overweight rating and a price target of $5.50; Marathon Digital (MARA) at underweight with a $5 target; Riot Platforms (RIOT) at underweight with a $6.50 target, and Cipher Mining (CIFR) at neutral. The bank also upgraded Iris Energy (IREN) to overweight from neutral. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on whether or not to approve a spot bitcoin ETF until this month. The crypto market is hopeful that any approval will trigger a flood of mainstream money into the sector. CleanSpark is the bank’s top pick, offering the best balance of “scale, growth potential, power costs and relative value.” The analysts said that Marathon is the largest mining operator but has the highest energy costs and lowest margins. Meanwhile, Riot has relatively low power costs and liquidity but is the most expensive stock in their coverage universe. Among the peers, Cipher Mining has the lowest power costs but is “growth constrained,” the report noted. The bank estimates the four-year block reward opportunity at around $20 billion at current bitcoin prices. However, the looming block reward halving, expected in the second quarter of 2024, could impact profitability. It estimates that as much as 20% of the network hashrate is at risk from halving as less efficient mining computers are decommissioned.

              "  'The connection between gold and bitcoin (BTC) as stores of value is obvious, and the demand for BTC as a digital store of value was a big reason why the cryptocurrency grew in popularity, crypto services provider Matrixport said in a report Monday. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is $540 billion, equivalent to 10.8% of the market cap of physical financial gold, Matrixport said, adding that gold exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) are valued at $200 billion. This is why potential approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF could result in inflows of $20 - $30 billion, potentially triggering a large rally in the cryptocurrency, the report said. The SEC has dragged its heels on approving a spot bitcoin ETF, and in August said it was delaying its decision on all new applications until October. The crypto market is hopeful that such an approval will trigger a flood of mainstream money into the sector. Still, bitcoin has an edge over gold as the private keys can be memorized, which eliminates the risk of confiscation, the report said. “Even today, storing assets in the form of gold has not only become unfashionable in the digital age, but comes with significant restrictions when crossing borders,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, adding that “bitcoin offers a solution to this dilemma, enabling the swift and relatively inconspicuous movement of value across borders.” “Therefore, considering the current state of technological developments, bitcoin’s primary roles are likely as a store of value akin to gold and a speculative financial asset,” the report added.

              "  'Bitcoin (BTC) is way off its 2021 peak and has been falling since hitting a 52-week high in July 2023. The price fluctuations in this benchmark crypto have also weighed down on other cryptocurrencies, and the digital currency market has been turbulent this year. In an environment of constantly rising interest rates, Bitcoin has struggled to attract speculators. However, being the most well-known and “reliable” digital coin, BTC has solidified its position within the market itself. At the beginning of the year, it accounted for about 38% of the entire crypto market. As of Oct 10, per CoinGecko data, it has extended its share to control more than 48.6% of the market. In comparison, the second most well-known crypto, Ethereum (ETH), has lost a major chunk of its market cap. In an uncertain environment, investors turn less speculative and rush to safety. Crypto investors are no different, just that Bitcoin has been making the most of this opportunity at the cost of altcoins. The crypto market has rebounded from the 2022 rout, and BTC’s revival peaked in July at a 90% appreciation in price. However, it has now settled back down to 67%. Since late September, it has been hovering above the $27,000 mark, almost hitting $28,000 on Oct 7. In this light, with growing institutional acceptance for crypto across geographies, the benchmark digital currency might be entering a period of less volatility and sustained growth. Multiple traditional financial houses applying for a Bitcoin ETF have also acted as a tailwind. The time maybe ripe to closely monitor a few stocks heavily exposed to BTC.
